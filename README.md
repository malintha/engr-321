## Lecture materials

- An introduction to dynamical systems in robotics
- Linear dynamical systems - part (1)
- Linear dynamical systems - part (2)
- Linear quadratic regulator

## Differential driven dynamics assignment
- Derives a differential driven robot dynamical model by completing a partial proof,
- Simulates the dynamical model using python and by solving differential equations.

## LQR assignment
- Linearizes an inverted pendulum dynamical model,
- Computes the gain matrix for the model using python,
- Visualizes and discusses the stability of the inverted pendulum for different gain values.
