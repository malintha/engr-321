## This repo contains lecture materials on,

- An introduction to dynamical systems in robotics
- Linear dynamical systems - part (1)
- Linear dynamical systems - part (2)
- Linear quadratic regulator.

## The differential driven dynamics assignment focuses on,
- deriving a differential driven robot dynamical model by completing a partial proof,
- simulating the dynamical model using python and by solving differential equations.

## The LQR assignment focuses on,
- linearizing an inverted pendulum dynamical model,
- computing the gain matrix for the model using python,
- visualizing and discussing the stability of the pendulum for different gains.
