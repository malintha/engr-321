# ENGR-321: Advanced Cyber Physical Systems 

## This repo contains some course materials I have prepared for the this class in spring 2021. Essentially the lectures include,

- An introduction to dynamical systems in robotics
- Linear dynamical systems - part (1)
- Linear dynamical systems - part (2)
- Linear quadratic regulator.

## The differential dynamics assignment focuses on,
- deriving a differential driven robot dynamical model,
- simulating the dynamical model using python and by solving differential equations.

## The LQR assignment focuses on,
- linearizing an inverted pendulum dynamical model,
- computing the gain matrix for the model using python,
- visualizing and discussing the stability of the pendulum for different gains.
